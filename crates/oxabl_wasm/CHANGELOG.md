# Changelog

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/compare/oxabl_wasm-v0.1.2...oxabl_wasm-v1.0.0) (2026-08-14)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `SymbolTable::inherited_member_type` and `record_inherited_member_type` are removed; read `Symbol::data_type`.
* **pipeline:** `oxabl check` no longer reports parse conformance. It lints and reports formatting drift, and its --json shape has changed accordingly. The previous behaviour, report text, --json shape, and exit codes are available unchanged as `oxabl conformance`.
* **api:** `oxabl::parse`, `oxabl::analyze`, `oxabl::analyze_with_fs`, and `oxabl_formatter::format_source` are deprecated in favor of their `try_*` siblings. They still compile and behave identically; callers denying deprecation warnings will need to migrate or allow them.
