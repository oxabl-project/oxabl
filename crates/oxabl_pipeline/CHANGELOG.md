## [1.0.0](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/compare/oxabl_pipeline-v0.1.0...oxabl_pipeline-v1.0.0) (2026-08-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `SymbolTable::inherited_member_type` and `record_inherited_member_type` are removed; read `Symbol::data_type`.
* **pipeline:** `oxabl check` no longer reports parse conformance. It lints and reports formatting drift, and its --json shape has changed accordingly. The previous behaviour, report text, --json shape, and exit codes are available unchanged as `oxabl conformance`.

### Features

* judge the cross-file population, and drain the top of the unmodelled-statement suppression ([#153](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/issues/153)) ([a1e03e6](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/commit/a1e03e6e1484ebd1bf3a7e6b194c74df8affbc4b))
* **pipeline:** one shared lint and format run behind every client ([#140](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/issues/140)) ([58d961e](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/commit/58d961e7d9b77e8887c78ee69580e60cc07f279f))
* **pipeline:** wire cross-file resolution into every client, and prove they agree ([#148](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/issues/148)) ([967331b](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/commit/967331bc7b4a0ae288dc5398a9f1c01d4be9278a))


### Bug Fixes

* **pipeline:** unblock the release run by dropping the self dev-dependency ([#145](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/issues/145)) ([a6878dc](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/commit/a6878dc011cb3794a43c4e2ad93d5e200fea39bf))
* resolve PR [#140](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/issues/140) review findings ([#141](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/issues/141)) ([dd0849e](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/commit/dd0849ea72d38ee68c404af1d2414b093ef64459))
