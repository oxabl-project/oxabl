# Changelog

## [1.0.0](https://github.com/oxabl-project/oxabl/compare/oxabl_lint-v0.1.0...oxabl_lint-v1.0.0) (2026-08-04)


### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

* `SymbolTable::inherited_member_type` and `record_inherited_member_type` are removed; read `Symbol::data_type`.
* **semantic:** UnresolvedReason gains NotFoundInWorkspace and Unknowable. An exhaustive match on it will no longer compile. Both are skip-listed by every lint rule, so no diagnostic changes.
